About BadClup:

BadClup was originally created by Bart≈Çomiej Strama, and he engaged some of his friends to the project. Quickly he started doing well with Tomasz Mamala, so he also obtained rank of CEO. After making few projects together, they got to mind, they can do somethin on big scale and that's how BadClup started going. Currently we are working on the own DNS system, which can be very succesful project.

At the start, all the projects, which has appeared all over the time (trust me there is many of them, but we don't have enough budget), we only in our minds, we knew we need to work very hard to achieve our dreams. We are putting all of our engagement in this project, because we want to make better world one day, with some of our inventions.
